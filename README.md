# Wake-on-LAN (WOL)

WOL or better `wol` is a command-line tool that allows
a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.
See [Wake-on-LAN on Wikipedia][wol].

NOTE: Yes, I do know similar tools exist already. It's just yet another
opportunity for me to practice Go and I want to use it.
